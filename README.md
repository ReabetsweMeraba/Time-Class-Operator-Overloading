# Time-Class-Operator-Overloading

This project is a C++ implementation of a `Time` class that showcases operator overloading techniques. It supports:
- Prefix and postfix increment (`++`)
- Subtraction of two time objects (`-`)
- Equality comparison (`==`)
- Overloaded input (`>>`) and output (`<<`) stream operators for user-friendly I/O

## Features

- Time validation for 24-hour format
- Leading zero formatting for hours, minutes, and seconds
- Demonstrates basic C++ class usage, encapsulation, and stream handling

## How to Run

Compile and run using a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
g++ time_class.cpp -o time_class
./time_class
